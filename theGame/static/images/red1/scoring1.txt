In this game, the scoring technique depends on a confident factor.
Before answering the question, the players should reply whether they
are confident with their answer or that they are not so sure and need
help.

If the player is confident and chose the correct answer, then he/she
will gain 2 points.

But if the answer was wrong, he/she will be fined 2 points.
